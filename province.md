# Province maps


### Prerequisites
We need previously created by desing maps. Maps will be divided into provinces. Each province has its own resources, enviromental hazards, adjacent provinces and possible town. On maps we can build new buildings to gather resources, have random events and start battles. Each province has its own movement penalty based on terrain and random events.
